# Authlete Provider

This provider allows you to manage the Authlete services and its configuration from terraform scripts. it supports the resources: [service](docs/resources/service.md).

This provider can be used to managed the tenant config, provider cloud instance or on premise instance of Authlete.

## Creating a testing account

if you don't have an account on Authlete cloud, go ahead and create a [free trial account](https://so.authlete.com/accounts/signup).


## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "terraform-provider-authlete" {
  # example configuration here
  service_owner_key = "16XXXXXXXX5"
	service_owner_secret = "SyfOCXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXnRaLPhCw" 
  api_server = "https://api.authlete.com"
}
```

The service_owner_key and service_owner_secret can be found under [your account on service owner console](https://so.authlete.com/profile?locale=en) as "API Key" and "API Secret". But as this is a sensitive information, don't push it to source control systems.

The provider can also be configured using environment variables. 

```bash
export AUTHLETE_API_SERVER="https://api.authlete.com"
export AUTHLETE_SO_KEY="16XXXXXXXX5"
export AUTHLETE_SO_SECRET="SyfOCXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXnRaLPhCw"
```

```terraform
provider "terraform-provider-authlete" {
  
}
```
